# Nidhogg IP Blacklist
# 
# In Norse mythology, Nidhogg is a dragon that gnaws at the roots of the World Tree, Yggdrasil.
# Similar to how Nidhogg poses a constant threat to the stability of the cosmic order,
# malicious or compromised IP addresses can pose risks to your network's security and stability.
# 
# Purpose: This list serves to collect and isolate such IP addresses,
# reducing risks and increasing overall security.
